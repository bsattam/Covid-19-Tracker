<h3 align = "center">Track Covid 19 Spread Around The World</h3>

## Motivation
I developed this website while learning asynchronous javascript, and learning how to call APIs. The world was shut down due to Covid-19, and I wanted to make something related to current world affairs. 

## Features
- Fetching data about covid 19 spread and vaccination using API calls
- Daily and total count of death, affected and recovered, for different user-defined intervals 
- Visualization through charts using ChartJS

## Demo

## Future Plans

- Adding daily statistics about vaccination
